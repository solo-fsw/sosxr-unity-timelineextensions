This versatile custom playable allows you to start a method via Timeline. It uses an interface (IInteract), and a method Interact();
Create your own class which implements IInteract, and use the Interact() method to either put in all your desired behaviour (see ExampleOneInteracting),
or link to your own method inside the interface method (see ExampleTwoInteracting).

A few things to note:
1) Each class you want to control with this needs to have the interface IInteract implemented, and the Interact() method as well.
2) The track binding is the class which has the IInteract interface attached to it.
3) The method will be called once per clip
4) Can be ONLY run while application is running (Play Mode & Build)

Feel free to amend these scripts to your liking. Check out the above resources for additional information on how to do so.
